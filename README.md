# Project Description:

This project proposes an IoT-based automatic alerting and indicating device designed to monitor the quantity of electrolyte in medical equipment, specifically electrolyte bottles used in hospital settings. The system utilizes a load sensor to measure the level of electrolyte fluid.

When the electrolyte fluid level falls below a certain threshold, notifications are sent to hospital staff via a dedicated Android application. Additionally, when the electrolyte bottle becomes empty, a servo motor is activated to stop the flow of fluid, and a notification is displayed on a monitor in the control room, indicating the room number of the patient for swift response by hospital staff.

# Tools and Technologies Used:

Android Studio: Used for developing the Android application interface.

Firebase Database: Employed for real-time data storage and retrieval.

Java: Programming language utilized for Android app development.

Arduino: Utilized for interfacing with the load sensor and servo motor, and controlling hardware components.

Load Sensor: Employed to measure the quantity of electrolyte fluid.

Servo Motor: Used to stop the flow of fluid when the electrolyte bottle is empty.
